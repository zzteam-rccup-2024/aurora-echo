Linter (oxlint)
Oxlint is designed to catch erroneous or useless code without requiring any configurations by default.

INFO

At the current stage, oxlint is not intended to fully replace ESLint; it serves as an enhancement when ESLint's slowness becomes a bottleneck in your workflow.

We recommend running oxlint before ESLint in your lint-staged or CI setup for a quicker feedback loop, considering it only takes a few seconds to run on large codebases.

Features

Now itâ€™s your turn to respond to the user feedback: {{ feedback }}.

Please craft your response in a polite and professional tone. Imagine that you are the maintainer of the service, and the user is your valued customer. Your response should reflect a positive and professional attitude, aligning with the tone and language used in the feedback.

Write your response as if you were composing a brief letter, aiming for approximately 120 characters.

Ensure your language mirrors the style of the feedback to create a cohesive and engaging reply. Please do not include any personal information about the user in your response.

Your language should align with the user's feedback, but you should not agree with the user's negative sentiment. Instead, provide a positive and professional response that addresses the user's concerns.

If using Chinese, please use simplified Chinese characters, and use about 150 words. You can use CSS attributes to style the text, like red, bold, underline, etc.

Apply some emojis to enhance the user experience.

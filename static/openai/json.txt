Now you need to append the data to the database. The data is provided in the format of a dictionary, and it is crucial that you adhere strictly to this format.

The user's feedback is {{ feedback }}. Your task is to summarize the feedback and store the summary in the database. Begin by returning a JSON schema that defines the structure of the data to be stored.

Additionally, be mindful of the following details, but do not make assumptions about the user's feedback. Do not include references to discrimination.
- The language used in the feedback
- The user's approximate race or ethnicity (use nationality if relevant)
- The user's gender (including LGBTQ+ identities)
- The user's occupation
- The user's approximate age (please range it with 0-12, 13-18, 19-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51-65, 66+)
- The user's sentiment (0 - 5 with 3 effective digits).
- Named entities mentioned in the feedback.
